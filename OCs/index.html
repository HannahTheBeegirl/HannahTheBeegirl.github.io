		<h3>hopefully this page will be filled soon!</h3>
		i've been working on designing my first ever OC for a few weeks now.
		it is going to be a pretty generic fursona but i'm excited!
		currently they are planned to be a shapeshifter, but their default form will be a catgirl, as i think that's the animal i most often resonate with!<br><br>
		hopefully when it's done, i will make more OCs so i can fill up this page with the cringiest nerd stuff ever
